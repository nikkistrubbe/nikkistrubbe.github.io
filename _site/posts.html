    Here I write about some - in my opinion - interesting things I have come across in my life.
    Mostly are mathematics related, but there are also some other topics.

        <h2><a href="/mathematics/2024/08/09/jordan-curve-theorem.html">The Jordan Curve Theorem</a></h2>
        <p>The Jordan curve theorem is one of the easiest theorems in mathematics, but really hard to prove. It is informally stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A closed curve in the plane that does not intersect itself, divides the plane in three parts: the interior of the curve, the exterior of the curve, and the curve itself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be intuitive, but do not be fooled, its proof is far from trivial! One of the problems is that curves ‘can be really wild’. In this post, we shall give the proof of the Jordan curve theorem and some related theorems.</p>

        <h2><a href="/mathematics/2024/08/09/division-rings-modules.html">Modules over Division Rings</a></h2>
        <p>A generally well-known fact in mathematics is that every vector space has a basis (assuming the axiom of choice of course – after all, why wouldn’t one assume it, if only for this reason?). One may wonder, are there other rings $R$ – apart from fields – that have the property that every $R$-module is free? It appears there are, called division rings. These are rings $R$ such that each element apart from 0 has an inverse, but $R$ need not be commutative. Fields and the quaternions $\H$ are the prime examples. In this post, we explore modules over division rings, and characterise division rings by the freeness of their modules.</p>

        <h2><a href="/mathematics/2024/08/09/electrodynamics-and-differential-geometry.html">Electrodynamics and Differential Geometry</a></h2>
        <p>Electrodynamics is concerned with describing the interaction between charges and currents, and electric $\bvec{E}$ and magnetic fields $\bvec{B}$. The electric and magnetic fields are related to the charge density $\rho$ (‘‘the amount of charge per volume’’) and the current density $\bvec{j}$ (‘‘the amount of charge flowing per unit time through a small area, pointing in the direction the charge is flowing’’), via the Maxwell equations:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
    \div{\bvec{B}} &amp;= 0&amp;&amp;\text{(Gauß's magnetic law)},&amp; \div{\bvec{E}} &amp;= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} &amp;&amp;\text{(Gauß's law)},\\
    \curl{\bvec{E}} &amp;= -\pdv{\bvec{B}}{t} &amp;&amp;\text{(Faraday's law)}, &amp; \curl{\bvec{B}} &amp;= \mu_0\bvec{j} + \epsilon_0 \mu_0\pdv{\bvec{E}}{t} &amp;&amp;\text{(Maxwell-Ampère law)}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Here $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are physical constants, called the permittivity of the vacuum and the permeability of the vacuum, respectively. We do not want to worry about them, so we choose units such that $\mu_0 = 1$ and $\epsilon_0 = 1$. There is a lot of hidden differential geometry going on, which is not yet visible. This I want to illustrate in this post.</p>

        <h2><a href="/mathematics/2024/08/09/basel-problem.html">The Basel Problem</a></h2>
        <p>In 1734 Euler showed that the infinite sum $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \ldots$ converges to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$. The infinite sum</p>

\[\zeta(s) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^s}\]

<p>is known as the ‘Riemann zeta function’, for $s \in \C$ such that $\Re s &gt; 1$. The Riemann zeta function can be extended to an analytic function $\zeta : \C\setminus\set{1} \to \C$.</p>

<p>Thus Euler effectively calculated $\zeta(2)$. His method was ‘factoring’ the sine function in term of its roots, as</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\sin z}{z} &amp;= \prn{1-\frac{z}{\pi}}\prn{1+\frac{z}{\pi}}\prn{1-\frac{z}{2\pi}}\prn{1+\frac{z}{2\pi}}\prn{1-\frac{z}{3\pi}}\prn{1+\frac{z}{3\pi}}\cdots\\
    &amp;= \prod_{k=1}^\infty \prn{1-\frac{z^2}{k^2 \pi^2}}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Then by by considering the Taylor series of $\frac{\sin z}{z}$ and comparing terms, he concluded that $\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$. His method can be extended to calculate $\zeta(2n)$, for $n \geq 1$ a natural number.</p>

<p>The problem is, however, is that he did not justify why $\sin z$ could be written as an infinite product of factors. The Weierstraß factorisation theorem (proved more than hundred years later by Karl Weierstraß) gave a justification. However, I would like to give a simpler way to calculate $\zeta(2n)$, using the residue theorem.</p>
